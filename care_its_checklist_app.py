# Checklist Sections
checklist_section("1. Cognitive-First (Start with Knowledge & Reasoning Tasks)",
    "Begin AI implementation by focusing on the cognitive domain (knowledge, reasoning). "
    "Reserve complex skills like empathy or manual techniques for human-led teaching.",
    [
        "Have we identified which learning objectives are best suited for AI delivery (vs. human-led)?",
        "Have we ensured AI focuses first on cognitive domain tasks (e.g. recall, reasoning)?",
        "Are more complex domains (e.g. psychomotor, affective) reserved for human interaction?"
    ]
)

checklist_section("2. Awareness",
    "Assess and improve understanding of AI among users. Many nurses equate AI with robots or surveillance. "
    "Clarify what AI can and cannot do.",
    [
        "Have we assessed usersâ€™ initial understanding of AI (e.g. via survey or workshop)?",
        "Have we addressed misconceptions (e.g. AI = robot)?",
        "Do users understand what AI will and will not do?"
    ]
)

checklist_section("3. Retention of Human Touch",
    "Maintain human-led teaching for empathy, communication, and judgement. AI should not replace tutors.",
    [
        "Is there a clear boundary between AI-led and human-led interactions?",
        "Are empathy, communication, and clinical judgement skills taught face-to-face?",
        "Are tutors still part of the process, not replaced?"
    ]
)

checklist_section("4. Ethics",
    "Ensure AI systems are transparent, explainable, and respect data privacy. "
    "Align with ethical nursing values.",
    [
        "Is the AI system explainable (i.e. does it show how decisions were made)?",
        "Are data privacy and security clearly addressed and explained to users?",
        "Have ethical concerns specific to nursing values been considered?"
    ]
)

checklist_section("5. Involvement",
    "Include nurses and students in co-design and feedback loops. Their input ensures real-world relevance.",
    [
        "Have nurses and nursing students been involved in co-design or feedback?",
        "Is their input visible in the systemâ€™s structure/content?",
        "Do they have a voice in future improvements?"

checklist_section("6. Time",
    "Allow adequate time for onboarding and training. Avoid overwhelming rollouts by using demos or opt-ins.",
    [
        "Is there adequate time allocated for onboarding and adaptation?",
        "Is the training optional or mandatory? If mandatory, is it flexible and fair?",
        "Is the AI system introduced in a non-overwhelming way (e.g. with early demos or opt-ins)?"
    ]
)

checklist_section("7. System Evaluation",
    "Conduct pilot tests and collect feedback to guide improvement. Define clear success metrics.",
    [
        "Has a pilot test been conducted (10â€“15 users for qualitative insights)?",
        "Is there a plan for continuous feedback and improvement?",
        "Are success metrics defined (e.g. usability, learning outcomes, trust)?"
