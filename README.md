# CARE-ITS AI Readiness Checklist

This is a Streamlit-based interactive checklist designed to evaluate institutional and developer readiness for implementing AI technologies in nursing education using the CARE-ITS framework.

## ðŸ§© CARE-ITS Pillars

- **Cognitive-First**: Focus on knowledge and reasoning tasks before integrating AI into complex domains like affective or psychomotor learning.
- **Awareness**: Ensure learners and staff understand what AI is and isnâ€™t, debunk myths, and promote clarity.
- **Retention of Human Touch**: Maintain the vital human side of nursing education (e.g., empathy, communication).
- **Ethics**: Ensure AI is transparent, secure, and aligned with nursing values and privacy regulations.
- **Involvement**: Actively include nurses and students in system design and iterative improvements.
- **Time**: Provide enough time for adaptation without overwhelming users with mandatory tasks.
- **System Evaluation**: Commit to feedback loops, pilot testing, and meaningful metrics of success.
