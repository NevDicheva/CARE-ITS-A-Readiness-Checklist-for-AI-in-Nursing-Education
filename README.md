# CARE-ITS: AI Readiness Checklist for Nursing Education

This is an interactive Streamlit app designed to help **institutions**, **AI developers**, and **educators** evaluate their readiness for implementing AI technologies in nursing education.

The framework builds on grounded theory findings from nursing professionals, distinguishing what should remain **human-led** (e.g., affective/psychomotor skills) and what can be **AI-supported** (e.g., cognitive knowledge tasks).

## CARE-ITS Pillars Explained

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **C ‚Äì Cognitive-First** | Begin AI implementation by focusing on the **cognitive domain** (knowledge, reasoning). Reserve complex skills like empathy or manual techniques for human-led teaching. This helps build trust without overwhelming users. |
| **A ‚Äì Awareness** | Assess and improve the **understanding of AI** among users. Many nurses equate AI with robots or surveillance. Clarify that AI can offer personalised feedback, not just automation. |
| **R ‚Äì Retention of Human Touch** | Maintain **face-to-face teaching** for empathy, communication, and clinical judgement. Clearly define what AI does **not** replace (e.g., mentorship, compassion). |
| **E ‚Äì Ethics** | Ensure AI systems are **transparent, explainable**, and respect **data privacy**. Institutions should follow ethical policies that align with nursing values. |
| **I ‚Äì Involvement** | Co-design with nurses and students. Their participation ensures the system meets **real needs** and encourages adoption through ownership. |
| **T ‚Äì Time** | Give users adequate **time to adapt**. Avoid overwhelming training‚Äîuse demos, workshops, or opt-ins rather than mandatory rollouts. |
| **S ‚Äì System Evaluation** | Pilot test with 10‚Äì15 users before deployment. Collect ongoing **feedback** and define clear **success metrics** (e.g., trust, usability, outcomes). |
